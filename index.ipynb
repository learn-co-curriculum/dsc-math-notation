Whereas we are used to expressing our algorithms in code, mathematicians prefer to use **_Mathematical Notation_**, to express big ideas in small, dense packages full of Greek letters, subscripts, and superscripts. Although these look intimidating in the beginning, they'll seem a lot more manageable once we've learned some basic mathematical notation. \n", "\n", "There are many, many mathematical symbols. We'll touch on the two very important ones here: the **_Summation_** symbol and the **_Product_** symbol. You'll use some of these in what's coming next, looking more in-depth at summary metrics such as the mean (you actually created a function for this in the previous lab!) and the variance.\n", "\n", "## Sigma Notation (Summations)\n", "\n", "In the equation above, you'll notice the following symbol appears:\n", "\n", "$$\\large \\sum $$\n", "\n", "This is called **_Sigma Notation_**, and is a way of notating **_Summation_**. \n", "\n", "Consider the following code:\n", "\n", "```python\n", "sum_total = 0\n", "n = 5\n", "for i in range(1, n+1):\n", "    sum_total += i\n", "```\n", "\n", "This is pretty simple code - just a for-loop that calculates the sum total of every number between 1 and 5, inclusive (meaning it stops after including 5 in the total, not before, which is why we put `n+1` in the range instead of just `n`).\n", "\n", "A mathematician would express the same algorithm using the following **_Sigma Notation_**:\n", "\n", "$$\\large \\sum_{n=1}^{5} x $$\n", "\n", "Pretty nifty, huh? The equation above says that we should start counting at 1, because we see `n=1` under the summation. We should stop once we've hit 5 (inclusive).

In our for loop, our index starts at 0, while in our Sigma Notation, our index starts at 1. In practice, they still mean the same thing--start at the first element in each list, multiply them, and add them to the sum, and then continue until we've done that for every item in the list `w`. The Sigma Notation starts at 1 because mathematicians start counting at 1, whereas programmers start counting at 0. **_Remember this--it'll save you from buggy code later on!_** \n", "\n", "## Pi Notation (Products)\n", "\n", "Another common type of notation is **_Pi Notation_**, which works similarly to Sigma Notation.
